# Getting Started with Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast and optimized development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run serve`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder.\
Useful for previewing the production build locally.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Code Splitting

Vite automatically handles code splitting for you.

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

You can use tools like [source-map-explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) to analyze the bundle size.

### Making a Progressive Web App

Vite does not include built-in support for making a Progressive Web App, but you can follow the [Vite PWA Plugin](https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/) guide to add this feature.

### Advanced Configuration

See the [Vite configuration guide](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more advanced configuration options.

### Deployment

You can deploy the production build from the `dist` folder to any static hosting service.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

If `npm run build` fails to minify, see the [Vite troubleshooting guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/troubleshooting.html).

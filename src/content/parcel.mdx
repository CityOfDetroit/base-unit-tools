# What is a parcel?

In this database, a parcel is a piece of real property (like a vacant lot), whose boundaries are defined by a very precise legal description.

Parcels are used to transfer ownership of property and they're used by the City for property assessment and taxation. If you own property in the City, you'll likely see its parcel number and legal description on the deed to your property and your tax bill.

Parcel boundaries are not something you can see like a building, but understanding where those boundaries are is critical to understanding who owns each building in the city.

## What are the important attributes of a parcel?

- **Parcel ID**: a unique ID for the parcel which appears in a wide range of contexts
- **Legal Description**: the legally binding description of the parcel boundaries
- **Property Class**: how the parcel is classified by the Office of the Assessor
- **Taxable Status**: indicates if the City assesses taxes on a parcel

## How are parcels maintained?

Parcels are maintained by the Office of the Assessor in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer of the City.

The mission of the Office of the Assessor is to locate, identify, and value at current market conditions all real and tangible personal property in the City of Detroit for the purposes of levying the tax lawfully imposed and to warrant said levy to the Treasurer of the City of Detroit for collection.

Parcels are used to determine the taxable status and assessed value of property in the City. Therefore, any revisions to parcel boundaries must follow the established procedures that support the administration of the Assessor's mission in the annual tax year cycle.

# What is an address?

Fundamentally, an address is a descriptive tag for a location like a parcel, building, or building unit.

Addresses are created by combining many different pieces of information:

- Street Number
- Street Prefix/Direction
- Street Name
- Street Type
- Unit Type
- Unit Number

There is often variation in the ways that these elements are written, arranged, and grouped.

For example, `123 E Main St. Apt 2` could also be written as `123 Main St. E Upper` and you'd still be able to figure out that they mean the same location. However, this variation can cause trouble for computers trying to interpret addresses. We've built a [geocoding tool](/geocoder) that takes in a list of Detroit addresses and standardizes them to the format used by the Enterprise Addresses database.

## Important attributes

- Links to the other base units that are described by that address (parcel, building, and unit)
- Link to the road segment that the address gets its street name information from
- ZIP code and deliverability status from the US Postal Service
